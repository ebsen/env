# Notes
Here lie third-party or modified color themes I use for my own Terminal, TextMate, and Xcode environments.

The Solerik themes are my own quick adaptations of Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme, since I couldn't find any for Xcode that I cared for.

The Quiet Light theme (for Xcode) isn't originally mine but it's been edited enough by me that I included it here. The TextMate theme is unmodified.

Everything uses Adobe's fantastic [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro) font.
